# Testing Folder

This could be made into its own branch, but for now I some python testing files that can be used to tinker around with the database.

## reset_table_test.py
This python file is meant to reset the table after any changes, currently I have it calling the sensor data table.

## add_data_test.py
This python file is being used to add data to the tables as small tests to get a better hand on utilizing the sqlite3 python library.
